#### Info:

 NeuraLIA tries to learn and reply the correct answer. 

 It acts as a neural network (with 66 neurons by default) and using OCR to search for and memorize patterns.

 You can enter the images you want in the /inputs/ folder and interact with the [AI] to train it.

 When re-analyzing the images, the [AI] will refine its results. 

 Finally, it will try to give you a conceptual answer about the content of ANY image that you have passed it...
